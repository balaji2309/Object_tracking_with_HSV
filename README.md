#Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking with OpenCV and HSV Color Detection

This project implements real-time object detection and tracking using OpenCV and HSV color detection techniques. It leverages computer vision to detect objects based on their color in live webcam feeds and tracks their movement across consecutive frames. Additionally, it saves the processed video with annotated objects.

#Key Features:

HSV Color Detection: Detect objects in real-time based on their HSV color range.
Object Tracking: Tracks detected objects across video frames.
Live Webcam Feed: Uses live webcam input for dynamic object detection and tracking.
Video Saving: Saves the processed video with annotated objects for further analysis.
This project is designed for learning and implementing object detection and tracking using OpenCV and Python. Feel free to explore the code, customize it, and integrate it into your own applications.
